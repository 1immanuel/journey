The first weeek was great. There was a bit of info overload but it was manageable. I'm happy to say i havent had any major problems understanding any of the concepts or tools that we were exposed to this week. Now that the week is over. I am really looking forward to the rest of the class. I really enjoy writing code so far and solving problems doing such. I feel like the sky is the limit and I'm very optimistic about my future in coding.
